#### This is a zip file extractor which uses "zip" to provides a basic framework for extracting zip files in Rust. 

Note: The provided code snippet doesn't include the complete implementation of the real_main function, which likely contains the actual logic for processing the zip file. The explanation above is based on the general structure and functionality of the code.
   * The code uses separate functions (main and real_main) to potentially improve code organization and maintainability.
   * It handles errors using unwrap (which panics on error). This should be replaced with proper error handling in real-world applications.
   * It demonstrates how to work with command-line arguments, files, directories, and zip archives in Rust.


##### Overview of Zip File Extraction Code


1. Command-Line Argument Processing:

    The code takes the path to the zip file as a command-line argument.
    If no filename is provided, it displays a usage message and exits.


2. Opening the Zip File:

    The code opens the specified zip file using `fs::File::open`.
    If the file cannot be opened, it returns an error.


3. Creating a Zip Archive Reader:

    The code creates a ZipArchive object from the opened file using `zip::ZipArchive::new`.
    This object provides methods to access and extract the contents of the zip archive.


4. Iterating Through Zip Entries:

    The code iterates through each entry in the zip archive using a loop.
    It extracts the name, comment, and size of each entry.


5. Extracting Files and Directories:

    For each entry:
        If the entry is a directory, it creates the corresponding directory structure using `fs::create_dir_all`.
        If the entry is a file, it extracts the file to the specified path using fs::File::create and io::copy.
        The code also handles potential errors during file creation and copying.
      
      - Setting Permissions: If the platform is Unix-like, the code attempts to set the permissions of the extracted files based on the permissions specified in the zip archive.

6. Command to run the code: `cargo run Sample.zip`.
